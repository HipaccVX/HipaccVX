# HipaccVX

An OpenVX implementation that achieves high performance for a wide variety of target platforms, namely GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs.


## How to use

Its best to look at the examples.
Tests and sample applications are already written and can be easily compiled:

```mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DTARGET_PLATFORM=opencl-cpu && make -j```

This corresponding HipaCC applications uses OpenCL on the CPU and can be found in the `build/samples` or `build/tests` subdirectory.
